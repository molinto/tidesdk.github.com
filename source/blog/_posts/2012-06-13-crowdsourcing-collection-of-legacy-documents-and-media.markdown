Since Appcelerator's announced the discontinuation of Titanium Destkop, we have been  concerned about the potential loss and disappearance of valuable media, articles and knowledge that has accumulated over time about this great product.

We need your eyes and actions to help us gather valuable media, articles, tutorials, sample apps, slide presentations (slideshares) and any other valuable knowledge that may help future users of TideSDK.

Please post your findings on our Google group at:

[TiDesktop Archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups&hl=en#!topic/tidesdk/B7k9KyVa3yg)

I believe anyone involved in this effort will be surprised about the wealth of information floating around that we must collect up and preserve.

Please join in our crowdsourced effort.
