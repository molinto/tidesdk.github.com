## A New Brand

As we are starting afresh with the Titanium Desktop project, we need a few items to get us going. Firstly, the development team got together and decided on the ‘TideSDK’ (see minutes of the meeting here). The next step is on the agenda is the logo, this we be used in the application, on the website, any future mailings & stationary.
