Our Wiki located at [https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/wiki](https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/wiki) continues to grow by leaps and bounds. We are receiving a lot of great information from the community and ask that you continue to share any valuable documents or media you may encounter concerning Titanium Desktop (the legacy SDK that TideSDK is growing upon). Much of this knowledge will live on through TideSDK to support our future users.

Frankly, we want to set an example in our project for the level of documentation and support we will deliver to users and developers alike. Truly, we believe that high levels of documentation and community support will translate into more satisfied users and contributors to the project. We have some very good technology that will continue to improve.

While folks patiently await our first release candidate, we will continue to provide Titanium Desktop from our downloads area at 

[https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/downloads](https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/downloads)

When TideSDK is released, there will be no changes in the API. If you have no experience the Titanium Desktop and would like to get started on a Desktop app today, you can begin with it (and transition to TideSDK as soon as we release in the very near future).

Come join us on #tidesdk on freenode.
