## Survey Results

Here is the results of the survey - we collected 69 responses and they are quite interesting and varied. In particular, there seems to be 2 camps; those who want the product to be a sandboxed "web server" of sorts, able to run PHP, Ruby, etc, and those who prefer a JavaScript approach with the removal of these excess languages. From what I gather, it also seems a lot of people have no idea exactly what the existing capabilities of Ti Desktop already are.
