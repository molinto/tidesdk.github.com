Our Friday session with Marshall Culpepper was to say the least 'awesome'. We are very grateful to have his support for the TideSDK project. As you may be aware, Marshall was TiDesktop's original developer and kroll was his 'baby'. The session was well attended and our group benefitted immensely from Marshall's insights.

Guiding the session using an outline prepared in advance, we gained from his knowledge of the past, discussed our present challenges, and looked toward the future. The session which ran a marathon 3+ hours, documented important legacy information, offered clarity concerning details of our project's architecture, helped with issues around our drillbit testing framework, our development approach, library upgrades, packaging, distribution and much more. 

The session ended with pledges to keep in touch along with a followup as we contemplate the challenges of Apple sandbox compliance. You will find a complete transcript of the session at:

A big thank you Marshall on behalf of all involved in the TideSDK project.
